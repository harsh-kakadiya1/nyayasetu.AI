Project Vision: "nyayasetu.ai" - Demystifying Legal Documents with Intelligent Insights
Project Name: nyayasetu.ai
Tagline: See Your Legal Documents Clearly. Understand Your Rights, Identify Risks, Take Action.
1. Core Functionality: The "LegalDoc Simplifier"
This is the foundation of LegalLens AI, designed to make any complex legal document immediately understandable.
1.1 Document Ingestion & Processing:
Input Methods: Users can upload documents (PDF, DOCX, TXT), paste text directly, or even provide a URL to a publicly accessible document.
OCR Integration (for PDFs): For scanned or image-based PDFs, Google Cloud's Document AI (or Cloud Vision API) will perform Optical Character Recognition to extract text accurately.
Text Extraction: Robust parsing for DOCX and TXT files to ensure full content capture.
Preprocessing: Cleaning the extracted text (removing headers/footers, non-essential characters, standardizing formatting) to optimize for GenAI input.
1.2 Comprehensive Plain-Language Summary:
GenAI Role: Utilizing Google Cloud's Vertex AI PaLM 2 (text-bison) or a suitable Gemini model, the AI will generate a high-level, jargon-free summary of the entire document's purpose, key parties, and overall intent.
Dynamic Length: Option for users to specify summary length (e.g., "brief," "standard," "detailed").
1.3 Key Clause Identification & Simplified Explanation:
GenAI Role: The AI will automatically identify and segment the document into its most critical clauses (e.g., "Term of Agreement," "Payment Schedule," "Scope of Work," "Indemnification," "Termination," "Governing Law," "Confidentiality").
Jargon Breakdown: For each identified clause, the GenAI will provide a separate, simplified explanation, breaking down complex legal terms into everyday language. This should use a direct, clear, and actionable tone.
Interactive Display: Each original clause will be displayed alongside its simplified counterpart, allowing users to easily compare and understand. Clicking on a simplified clause could reveal further plain-language definitions of specific terms within it.
1.4 Interactive Q&A (Basic Level):
GenAI Role: A simple chat interface allowing users to ask natural language questions about the document. The GenAI will retrieve relevant information from the processed document and generate concise, accurate answers, always grounding its responses in the provided text to prevent "hallucinations."
Focus: Answering factual questions directly derived from the document's content.
2. Advanced Features: "Risk Radar & Unfair Terms Identifier"
This feature elevates LegalLens AI from an explainer to a proactive protector, giving users critical insights into potential pitfalls.
2.1 Risk/Advantage Highlighting:
GenAI Role: Beyond just explaining, the GenAI (potentially fine-tuned or using more sophisticated prompting with a "risk assessment" persona) will analyze clauses for common risks, obligations, or potential advantages for the user.
Visual Cues: Uses a clear traffic light system (Red: High Risk/Warning, Yellow: Caution/Obligation, Green: Advantageous/Standard) or icons to flag clauses.
Examples:
Red Flag: "This clause grants the other party broad rights to terminate without cause," or "You are solely responsible for all maintenance and repairs."
Yellow Flag: "This document requires a 60-day notice period for termination," or "Late payments incur a 15% penalty."
Green Flag: "This clause limits your liability under certain conditions."
2.2 "Unfair" or "Unusual" Term Detection:
GenAI Role: The AI can be trained or prompted to identify clauses that significantly deviate from common industry standards for that document type (e.g., an unusually high late fee in a rental agreement, an excessively broad non-compete clause, or a waiver of significant rights). This could involve some form of RAG where the model has access to a curated dataset of "standard" or "fair" clause examples to compare against.
Explanation of Deviation: When an unusual term is flagged, the AI will explain why it might be considered unusual or unfair and what the potential implications are.
User Input (Optional): Allow users to indicate the document type (e.g., residential lease, business contract) to help the AI contextualize "standard" terms.
2.3 Contextual Warnings:
GenAI Role: Provide warnings about common scenarios not explicitly covered, but implied, or highlight areas where ambiguity could lead to future disputes.
Example: "While not explicitly stated, this broad 'catch-all' clause regarding property damage could be interpreted to include minor wear and tear."
3. Advanced Features: "Actionable Steps & Checklist Generator"
This feature empowers users by transforming understanding into concrete guidance, fostering informed decision-making.
3.1 Personalized Action Plan:
GenAI Role: Based on the analyzed document and identified risks/obligations, the GenAI will generate a personalized list of concrete, practical steps th...
